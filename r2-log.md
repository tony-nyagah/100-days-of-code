### Day 4: September 5th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the challenge dealing with the Time package in Go on Exercism and worked on day 1 to 5 of the September 2023 CodeMarch challenges.

**Thoughts:** Learning that the Time package in Go has predetermined dates that are used to format strings into dates was an interesting experience. Also going back to the basics with HTML and CSS and such will open my eyes in regards to learning new technologies in frontend like React.

### Day 5: September 7th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished the day 6 and 7 projects of the September 2023 CodeMarch challenge and started working on the map challenge using Go on Exercism.

**Thoughts:** Learning HTML structure before going into the harder stuff like React is important. Also Go seems like a pretty easy language to learn. Guess it's because I have experience in other languages.
